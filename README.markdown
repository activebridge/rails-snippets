Better Snipmate Snippets for VIM
========================

Short info...
-------------

This repository is kind of hybrid of [snipmate.vim](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim) and [snipmate-snippets](https://github.com/scrooloose/snipmate-snippets).

Installation
------------

I recommend installing `vundle`, and
then simply add next line to your vimrc file:

    Bundle 'galulex/rails-snippets'
